# A Work Day Scheduler
Everyone has needed some kind of agenda where they can keep track of their tasks. Whether you are a student or working, you might find using a  schedule can help keep you more organized. That is why I created this work day schedule to help someone keep themselves a bit more organized! This challenge was given to me for the UCF Coding Bootcamp, so I tried to input as much as I could from what I have learned so far.



# Here is the ask for the challenge:
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

# Here is the criteria to follow for the challenge:
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
